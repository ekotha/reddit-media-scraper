<!-- ABOUT THIS PROJECT -->
## About This Project

I find myself saving a lot of images and gifs from reddit–be it memes, or pictures for the moodboard. So I figured that if I could scrape for media, I could then later go through the files and save/tag whatever was relevant to my writing or ideas. 
This has made my workflow a hundred times faster. Feel free to tweak this code to your own needs! I hope you find it useful. :)

I'm probably going to refactor sections of this in the future to make it neater and more elegant than it currently is. I'm thinking a GUI would be cool, perhaps an implementation of granular controls based on subreddit filters, etc. Any changes to the codebase will be reflected in this document.
The project doesn't grab media from posts that contain galleries, I might try to add support for those in the future.
